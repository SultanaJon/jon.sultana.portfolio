# Jon Sultana — Developer Portfolio

This is my personal developer portfolio built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), styled with Tailwind CSS, and inspired by the clean, developer-friendly interface of the Hoppscotch HTTP client. It showcases my projects, technical skills, and love for building modern web applications.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

 - **Forking**: This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account. You can make changes and submit pull requests if you want to contribute.
 - **Cloning**: If you just want a personal copy for yourself, you can clone the repository to your local machine. 

 To clone the repository, run the following command:

## 🛠️ Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```
The app will run at http://localhost:3000/about by default.

## 🌐 Deployment

This project is ready to deploy on platforms like [Vercel](https://vercel.com), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), or any service that supports Next.js.

### 🔧 Deploying to Vercel (Recommended)

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in with your GitHub account.
2. Click **"New Project"** and import your repository.
3. Vercel automatically detects your Next.js setup.

Every push to your `main` branch will trigger a new deployment automatically.

### ⚙️ Other Options

- **Netlify** — Great for static sites (`next export` required).
- **Render** — Works with SSR and APIs too.
- **GitHub Pages** — Only for fully static builds (no SSR or API routes).

Choose based on your project needs, but Vercel is the easiest and most feature-rich for Next.js apps.
